- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel Perez Diaz. 
- I´m an industrial engineer with more than 15 years of experience in logistics.
- A few years ago I began a professional reorientation process with the aim of joining the technology field, 
- specifically the field of data science and machine learning.
- 👀 I am particularly interested in the application of the latest AI technologies in the field of quantitative finance and sports. 
- It is because of them that I am learning in this field 🌱 and I want to collaborate in projects of this nature. 💞️
- 📫 You can write to me at miguelpdiaz02@gmail.com
